- **Wishlist**: Mark products as favorites (wishlist functionality).
- **Customizable Filter**: Option to filter by customizable products.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`)
- **API**: [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
- **CSS**: Plain CSS (no CSS frameworks)
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed to platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
